# NOÉMIE GOUDAL

### PHOENIX

Anchored in ideas around deep time (which can be loosely defined as a geological history of the planet), paleoclimatology (the study of past climates) and relational geographies, Noémie Goudal’s complex and performative series of films and constructed photographs reflect on the inter-connectedness of human and non-human life. Knitting together lush vegetation, rocky coastlines, snow-capped mountains and swamplands, her latest body of work explores spatiotemporal vastness and post-anthropocentric modalities of belonging. Goudal’s poetic film _Inhale Exhale_, 2021, considers how the Earth is in a state of perpetual movement by depicting an unspecified equatorial landscape that was once part of the arctic environment in a constant state of transition. Meanwhile, her series _Phoenix_, from which the exhibition takes its name, deploys optical illusion and altered realities to question photography’s indexicality as a marker of truth. Ultimately, Goudal’s theatrical work marks a philosophical shift in our approach to ecology and an awareness of how the Earth’s temporal rhythms are critical for planetary survival.
