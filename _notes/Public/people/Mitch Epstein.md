Mitch Epstein è marito di Mira Nair, regista indiana della quale devo recuperare film visti in gioventù.

Questo è un reportage sul'India molto esteso che, a parte alcuni scatti, non riesce a passarmi molto.

Ho trovato rilevanti questi.

Però molti scatti mi sono sembrati banali e puramente descrittivi. Forse sono passato troppo velocemente.

Between 1978 and 1989, Mitch Epstein made eight trips to India and shot thousands of photographs. The result is an extensive body of work that shows Epstein’s unusual dual vantage in an extraordinarily complicated culture: Through his Indian family life and work, he was both an insider and outsider. These photographs, many of which are exhibited here for the first time, show a wide swath of subcultures which Epstein was able to enter, showing a deep and extended experience of India, where separate worlds converged. The Abbaye de Montmajour installation features remastered prints from this body of work and is presented alongside two of the films Epstein collaborated on in India, with his then Indian wife, director Mira Nair: _India Cabaret_ (1985) and _Salaam Bombay!_ (1988). These works recall a time that feels both distant and immediate, complicated with politically fraught codes of caste, class, and religion, but simpler without the intrusion of digital technology.
