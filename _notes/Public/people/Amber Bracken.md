[Amber Bracken](http://amberbracken.com/), a lifelong Albertan, is a freelance photojournalist based in Edmonton, Canada, who photographs primarily across western North America to better connect to the global issues in her own backyard.   
  
Her work explores intersections of race, environment, culture and decolonization, specializing in invested relationship based and historically contextualized storytelling that centers people in their own stories. Recent work has focused on the ongoing legacy of intergenerational trauma from Residential “Schools” for Cree and Metis youth, Wet'suwet'en reoccupation and land rights fights, the overrepresentation of un-housed Indigenous people displaced in their historic territories, and interrogating the impact of race in her own family.   
  
Select clients include _National Geographic_, _The Globe and Mail_, _The Wall Street Journal_, BuzzFeed, Maclean's, ESPN, and _The New York Times_. She has received numerous awards and recognition, including The Marty Forscher Fellowship and an ICP Infinity Award.
