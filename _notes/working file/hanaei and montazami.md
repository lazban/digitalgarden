The BMW ART MAKERS program enables a duo, consisting of an emerging artist and a curator (applying together), to produce an experimental work related to contemporary image-making and installation. Artist Arash Hanaei and curator Morad Montazami, the first duo to win the prize, present the exhibition _Suburban Hauntology_. The project is a reconsideration of our relationship to forms of utopian architecture from the 1960-70s, and the peripheral ecosystems of the suburbs that accommodate them, by immersing them in the virtual world of the metaverse and augmented reality. According to the duo, it is “an innovative installation project, offering poetry and a visual policy that considers the spectator’s emancipation in an era of image capture, big data and algorithmic warfare”. Thus, the Internet finds a speculative double, a trick mirror of its standardized landscapes in the suburbs; and the suburbs find in the Internet a time machine, the unexpected, perhaps indecipherable extension of its vanished utopias.

EXHIBITION PRODUCED BY BMW ARTS MAKERS.
