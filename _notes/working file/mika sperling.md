How does one break a family and social taboo? Mika Sperling tries to address this question in _I Have Done Nothing Wrong_. Armed through vulnerability and braced by resilience, maintaining a keen awareness of the facts in order to reject violence, the artist expresses the crimes of her grandfather through three complementary series. First, five photographs produced in collaboration with the artist’s daughter on the road from her childhood home to that of the perpetrator. Then, meticulously cut out family photos. And finally, a fictive scenario between a deceased grandfather and an artist looking for answers.
