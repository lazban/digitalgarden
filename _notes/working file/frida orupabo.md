In her collages, Norwegian-Nigerian artist Frida Orupabo dismembers then reassembles bodies, especially those of black women, to denounce the brutality of how they have been depicted in painting throughout history. Gathering her visual material from the Internet, she integrates family photographs into artistic, popular, scientific, ethnographic and medical imagery to address colonial violence, racism, identity and sexuality. Scar-like tears appear in her collages, where she deconstructs stereotypes and the process of objectifying, fixating and being othered in which photography has been an accomplice. Frida Orupabo expresses a subtle form of resistance that thwarts the dominant gaze and constantly encourages viewers to reflect on the position they occupy.
