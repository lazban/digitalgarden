_From what she told me, and how I feel_ comes of a collaboration between Celeste Leeuwenburg and her mother, visual artist Delia Cancela. After discovering a film in her mother’s library, produced by her in the 1970s, the artist decides to provide the little piece of punk and feminist history with a modern interpretation. Part parade, part performance, part dance, the work was made with a dozen non-professional dancers, among whom Cancela and Leeuwenburg. At stake are the limits of documentary, as are the boundaries between film and photography. The artist-daughter’s gesture confronted with her artist-mother’s legacy considers questions of lineage, navigating between cultural and family heritage. Here, bodies retain family memories, historical awarness, and their multiple interpretations.

# CÉLESTE LEEUWENBURG

Born 1986 in Paris, France.  
Lives and works in Paris, France.

French-Argentine artist Celeste Leeuwenburg trained alongside other artists in Argentina before returning to France for a residency. In her work, she tries to revive the memory of the art movements of the 1970s and 1980s, especially dance and performance, paying particular attention to the direction of bodies. The series _From What She Told Me, and How I Feel_ marked her start as a video artist. Forten years, she has worked on a documentary project about an Argentine dancer, Marcia. Her work has been exhibited in Paris, Buenos Aires, Madrid and New York.
