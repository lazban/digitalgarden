_To Heal a World_ is the result of over two years of research within the archives of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The exhibition includes more than 600 images, dated 1850 to the present, from that underexplored collection. Most of the photographs on display were taken to inform the public about urgent humanitarian issues, while others were intended for internal use. Work by some of photography’s biggest names – including members of Magnum Photos – is presented alongside images taken by humanitarian workers themselves and a project by Alexis Cordesse, who collected personal photos from men and women who fled Syria. Multiple points of view converge to explore humanitarian imagery and the complexity of work in the field beyond its representation in photographs.
