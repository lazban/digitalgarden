The temperate rainforests of Araucania in southern Chile have gradually been replaced by monocultures of pine and eucalyptus from massive cloning in order to develop the paper pulp industry. The Mapuche (“people of the earth”) lived there long before the country was founded. Today, they are fighting to save biodiversity, especially medicinal plants. Meanwhile, the exploitation and trafficking of resources are fueling violence between nationalist organizations, industrialists’ private militias and the army’s special anti-terrorist forces. Two worldviews are clashing. One is based on free-market economics, the other considers the relationship to the environment a spiritual one. The photographic inquiry of Ritual Inhabitual also reveals the ecological and political consequences of monoculture forestry, opening a debate on our consumption.
