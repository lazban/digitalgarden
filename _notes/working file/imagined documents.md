The idiom of photographs can reach far beyond the world as we see it. Images which escape an indexicality to the ‘real’, can play between fact and fiction to re-present a hyper-real, abstract, imaginary, or even deeply social or political moment. They present another kind, and possibly a more enduring reflexivity. The artists here, by controlling each element of the frame, pre-determine the image. Recreating scenes from memory, constructing elaborate sets, staging selves, or retelling personal encounters, they address a range of immediate issues and concerns. Delving into techniques and histories of theatre, cinema, performance, literature, poetry and fiction, the mises-en-scène produced may be populated with found objects or sculpted elements, re-imagined as real topographies, or as conceptual narratives. The exhibition showcases contemporary works by artists pursuing such practices from South Asia and its neighbourhood.
