The show focuses on one of the most intense and productive periods in the life of American photographer Lee Miller (1907–1977). Between 1932 and 1945, she was a portraitist, head of her own studio in New York (1932– 1934), a fashion and advertising photographer for perfume and cosmetic brands (1932–1945) and a war photographer (1942–1945) whose images of Dachau and Buchenwald are especially well known. Miller effortlessly moved between milieus and was concerned with the exchange value of her work. The exhibition explores her vibrant career and fleshes out the portrait of a woman often remembered only for her collaboration with American artist Man Ray and her close ties with the Surrealists in the 1920s.

# LEE MILLER

Born 1907 in Poughkeepsie, United States.  
Died 1977 in Farleys House, Muddles Green, United Kingdom.

Lee Miller began her photographic career as a top fashion model for _American Vogue_ and _Vanity Fair_. In 1929, she became the lover and collaborator of Man Ray in Paris, and within a year ran her own Paris studio, in Montparnasse. In October 1932, she returned to America and set up Lee Miller Studios Inc. in Manhattan, New York, which despite the Depression managed to operate at a small profit in its first year of trading. She closed the studio in mid 1934 to live in Egypt with her husband Aziz Eloui Bey. Her surrealist images from this period are among her most famous, which along with her extraordinary Second World War fashion and combat photographs have earned her a key place in the history of art.
