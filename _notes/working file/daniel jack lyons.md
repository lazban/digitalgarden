Given his background in social anthropology Daniel Jack Lyons understands the sociopolitical stakes of representing the other. He thus takes great care to reinvent himself. _Like a River_ was born out of an invitation to join a youth center in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. On site, he met queer and trans youth torn between hope and disillusion, bound by tradition and heritage, struggling to assert their difference within their community. Lyons offered to take their portraits, allowing them to choose the session’s location and their clothing and pose, so that the work can be considered as a collaboration. A member of the LGBT community himself, he was able to create a safe space and open the field of possibilities for exploring how to represent oneself. _Like a River_—named in tribute to Amazon-born poet Thiago de Mello— became an emancipatory space for a queer youth struggling to exist.
