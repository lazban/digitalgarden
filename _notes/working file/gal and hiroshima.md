G and H are the initials of artist duo Gal (Marinelli Cipreste) and Hiroshima (Rodrigo Masina Pinheiro). Rodrigo, who owes her Japanese nickname to the fact that she has an appearance between genres, survived being stoned as a child for having asserted her non-standard identity. Gal is trans herself. Together, they fight to free their pasts from shame, and proudly choose life in a country where violence against the LGBTQIA+ people is still taking its toll. The duo uses the symbolic power of images to ward off trauma, finding a balance between the finesse of the story and the violence of the subject. In the series _GH. Gal & Hiroshima_, amidst a constellation of objects and gestures, a high heel shoe, symbol of a supposed “femininity”, becomes recurring evidence for the crime of not performing one’s assigned gender.
