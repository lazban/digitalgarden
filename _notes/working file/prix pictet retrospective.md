Since it began in 2008 the Prix Pictet has become one of the world’s leading prizes for sustainability and photography. For each new cycle, the Prix Pictet adopts a different theme. There have, to date, been four cycles of the award –Water, Earth, Growth, and Power. The fifth cycle Consumption concludes with an exhibition of work by the eleven shortlisted artists at the V&A in London in May 2014 at which the Honorary President, Kofi Annan, will present the award. In the six years since it began sixty eight of the world’s leading photographers (including Edward Burtynsky, Naoya Hatakeyama, Thomas Struth, Taryn Simon, Susan Derges, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Joshua Cooper, Darren Almond and Robert Adams) have been shortlisted for the Prix Pictet. The exhibition at the Parc des Ateliers will be a survey of the first five cycles of the award. It will present images from all of the shortlisted photographers and there will be a particular focus on the work of the laureates –Benoît Aquin, Nadav Kander, Mitch Epstein, Luc Delahaye. Aquin, Kander and Epstein will present work they have made since winning the Prix Pictet, in which sustainability is an important element. Epstein will show work from his acclaimed _New York Arbour_ series while for Aquin and Kander the exhibition is a platform for previously unseen work. Aquin will show images made in the aftermath of the 2013 Megantic disaster which was largest land oil spill in North America. Kander, on the otherhand, will show work from his new series _Dust_ a three year survey of secret Soviet scientific cities and missile test sites.
