The exhibition Special Attention gives several graduates of École nationale supérieure de la photographie the opportunity to show their work in the context of the Rencontres d’Arles. This year’s jury, composed of Christoph Wiesner, Marta Gili, Lukas Hoffmann and Estefanía Peñafiel Loaiza, chose works that examine the relationship between bodies and their environment. Cassandre Colas looks into urban spaces, obsessively analyzing the ways in which our bodies inhabit, traverse and perceive these transitional places, caught between fascination and repulsion. Gaëlle Delort exhibits part of her work Karst, about the limestone plateaus of the Grands Causses region. Characteristic spaces of the _karst_’s relief, caves and abysses shelter the history of their explorations. They are also thresholds where the landscape changes.
