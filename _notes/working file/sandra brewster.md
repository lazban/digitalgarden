The _Blur_ series (2017-present) brings together photographic portraits transferred with gel to various surfaces, including the architecture of exhibition venues. The transfer technique, a metaphor of movement and change, evokes the story of the artists’ parents, who immigrated from British Guyana to Canada in the late 1960s. Sandra Brewster is interested in the sentimental value of old family photographs and their relationship to memory and the passage of time. She focuses, by exaggerating it, on the materiality of the medium, revealing in particular the imperfections— folds, tears and streaks—left during the installation of the prints. The artist directs her subjects to move while taking their picture, in order to explore complex, layered and fluid experiences of identity.
