Léa Habourdin’s work starts out with a simple observation reported by the press: primary forests no longer exist in metropolitan France. The surviving ones have not been overly influenced by humans in recent decades. The artist spent two years with forest rangers and conservation area managers documenting these protected areas. Then she made prints by extracting the photosensitive chlorophyl from plants and using plant pigments made by an artisan. The prints, called anthotypes, are not resistant to daylight. From bright yellow birch leaves to pale pink poppy petals, the image of the forest she captures is evanescent, resonating with the fantasy we all have about the primary forest.

# LÉA HABOURDIN

Born 1985 in Lille, France.  
Lives and works in Paris, France.

Léa Habourdin studied printmaking at the École Estienne in Paris and photography at the École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie in Arles. With a keen eye for the diversity of life forms, she observes our relationship with other animals and landscapes and summons up the notions of survival, fracture, and reconstruction to develop a vision of what we call “the wild.” She explores the fields of ethology, applied science, and botany to create drawings and photographs where the book and printed material play a key role. She received the Carte Blanche PMU-LE BAL in 2015, the CIPGP grant in 2019, and support for documentary photography from CNAP in 2020.
