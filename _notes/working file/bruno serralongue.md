From April to November 2016, the sioux Indians on the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota, joined by other nations and activists, set up a camp on the banks of the Missouri River near Lake Oahe to oppose the plan to bury the Access Pipeline under the Dakota River. The people living on the reservation, which is downstream from the lake, fear that leaks might pollute the river. Up to 10,000 people lived in the camp, called Oceti Sakowin, during a standoff with the army and the police in late November 2016. Their protest led President Obama to suspend the project. Then, his successor, Trump, ordered the army to resume building the pipeline. Despite the dismantling of Oceti Sakowin, the Indians’ opposition to the destruction of their “sacred land” did not falter. It took other forms on other fronts. The _Water Protectors_ series (2017 to present) explores this continuously renewed struggle.

# BRUNO SERRALONGUE

Born 1968 in Châtellerault, France.  
Lives and works in Pantin, France.

Bruno Serralongue studied art history and attended the École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie in Arles and the Villa Arson in Nice. As a freelancer covering major newsworthy events in the 1990s, he grew interested in photography’s power to inform and its impact on our daily lives. He calls the medium’s objectivity into doubt, asserts that photographers have a duty to provide truthful images, and questions the production process of the media image. His work has been featured in several major monographic exhibitions, including at Wiels in Brussels (2009) and the Jeu de Paume (2010), the Centre Pompidou (2019), and the FRAC Île-de-France (2022) in Paris.
