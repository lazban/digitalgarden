_I can’t stand to see you cry_ begins at a dying father’s bedside and continues, despite the burden of grief, as the world starts to experience a pandemic, and the United States witness George Floyd’s execution. It is an autobiography informed by history, where the healing of the author’s wounds and the reduction of the country’s fractures are at stake. If the work is inscribed in documentary tradition, it’s with a desire to redefine and update what is an image. The young photographer draws strength from vulnerability to create an intimate work in permanent dialogue with those around him. Alongside his photos, for the first time, objects have been incorporated, items from Texan vernacular heritage, as well as moving images in tribute to his childhood VHS.
