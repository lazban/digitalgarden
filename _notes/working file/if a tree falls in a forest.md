_If a Tree falls in a Forest_ brings together works by artists who critically observe voids and silences by questioning the approach, redrawing the subjects’ outlines, or breaking with the very semantics of photography. From Mahmoud Khattab's behind-the-scenes photo-journal of his year as a conscript to Jansen Van Staden's photographic essay on the unseen aspects of a father-son relationship and Belinda Kazeem-Kamiński's performative investigation of colonial archives, the show takes an investigative look at individual and collective memory. Among other things, it addresses the specter of colonialism and the trauma of alterity, and suggests new spaces of representation. _If a Tree Falls in a Forest_ beckons viewers to carefully observe the boundaries of the visible and the tropisms that underlie them.  
  
Rahima Gambo (1986), Wiame Haddad (1987), Amina Kadous (1991), Belinda Kazeem-Kamiński (1980), Mahmoud Khattab (1991), Jansen Van Staden (1986).
