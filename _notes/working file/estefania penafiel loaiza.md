As part of the ENSP’s 40th anniversary celebration, this exhibition is the culmination of the 2021/2022 educational residency program led by Estefanía Peñafiel Loaiza along with seven students (Beatriz De Souza Lima, Ludivine Fernandes, Juliette Frechuret, Loïsà Gatto, Basile Lorentz, Iris Millot, Christiane Rodrigues Esteves) and a teacher, Nicolas Giraud of the ENSP. It brings together a series of elements that retrace a journey the artist took between Ecuador and Italy in the footsteps of a ghost: Carmen, vanished in Ecuador in the early 1980s after joining a revolutionary movement. Based on a true story, using letters written by Carmen working underground as a starting point, the project simultaneously follows possible destinies for this dual woman, both real and imaginary. Through video, photography, objects and archival documents, like unsorted scenes or unassembled puzzle pieces, the exhibition shapes a narrative fluctuating between documentary research and fiction, in which echoes of a bygone era can still be heard today.

EXHIBITION PRODUCED BY THE ACADÉMIE DE FRANCE À ROME – VILLA MÉDICIS, THE GALERIE ALAIN GUTHARC AND THE ÉCOLE NATIONALE SUPÉRIEURE DE LA PHOTOGRAPHIE.
