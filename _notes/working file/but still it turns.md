This collective exhibition presents photography from life as it is — in all its complicated wonder — in the twenty-first-century United States: from Vanessa Winship’s peripatetic vision in _She Dances on Jackson_ through Curran Hatleberg’s gatherings of humankind in _Lost Coast_; Richard Choi’s meditation on the differences between the flow of life and our memory of it in _What Remains_; RaMell Ross’s images of quotidian life from _Hale County_; Gregory Halpern’s luminous Californian journey in ZZYZX; Piergiorgio Casotti and Emanuele Brutti’s _Index G_ on the delicate balance between economic theory and lived fact; Kristine Potter’s re-examination of the Western myth of 'manifest destiny' in _Manifest_; or Stanley WolukauWanambwa’s braiding the power of images with the forces of history in _All My Gone Life_. This photography is _post_-documentary. No editorializing or narrative is imposed. That there is no story is the story. For these artists, all of life is in play and everything matters — here is a freedom, hard won, sometimes confusing, but nonetheless genuine: a consciousness of life and its song.
